# THIS IS NOT BASED ON TURBOWARPS DESKTOP SOURCE CODE.

This is not based on desktop turbowarps source code, to make this clear its not going to have the same features as it, but for a fast-launch alternative to gvbvdxx mod 2.

# Libary assets may not load while offline.

Assets may not load while offline, this is because gvbvdxx mod 2's code is already large enough as github can't store the builds in brances (without large file storage, which I don't know how to do yet).

# Features:

* Offline compatibility - Work on you're Gvbvdxx Mod 2 projects when you don't have internet.

* Addons supported - Customize features that you want with Gvbvdxx Mod 2's built in Scratch Addons features.

* Faster to load - Since Gvbvdxx Mod 2 is NOT being loaded from a server, you are experiencing the fastest load times possible by your device's speeds.

* A more full screen experience - This does not contain a browser interface and makes a larger viewing area for you to use.

* Less stress - Because there is no browser interface, there is less stress on you're devices resources, this might make editing projects and doing things a lot faster.

* ALL built in extensions are importable offline - The extensions are what make Gvbvdxx Mod 2 very diffrent from your typical Scratch, and without them being offline compatible, you can't really experience Gvbvdxx Mod 2 offline cant you?
